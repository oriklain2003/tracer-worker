# Example Flight IDs for Batch Classification
# One flight ID per line (lines starting with # are ignored)
#
# These are example IDs from your context - replace with actual flight IDs from your database
#
# To find unclassified flights, run:
# psql -t -c "SELECT flight_id FROM research.anomaly_reports WHERE is_anomaly = TRUE LIMIT 10" > flight_ids.txt
#
# Then run:
# python batch_classify_flights.py --file flight_ids.txt
